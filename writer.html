                            David Baltimore is 1975 Nobel Prize laureate in Physiology or Medicine, a Professor of Biology and 6th President of Caltech. I met him during an entrepreneurial course where he was invited to share his research and insights on other cutting-edge technologies. I inquired him whether I can interview him to inspire the younger generation, and he said yes. On a sunny afternoon, I was invited to his office and have a conversation with him.

                            Robert Howard Grubbs is a co-recipient of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on olefin metathesis. He is a co-founder of Materia, a University spin-off startup to produce catalysts. After he agreed to accept my interview invitation, I learned that he started a variety of chemical and pharmaceutical companies, and he has many insightful thoughts about technology incubcation from academia.

He shared with me his love for maths and chemistry, and how he worked hard towards his research dream since a child. Five years after my interview with him, I visited him again. He is nearly 100 years old now, and he is still working hard in his office.
