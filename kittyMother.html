                    They joined my family in 2018. The two boys are cute, considerate and loving. Pitton is so smart that he can quickly learn how to turn on and off the lights at home, and sometimes he is watching me code and play computer games. I am thinking he is actually interested and learning! Dublin is like a little kid and he loves to follow me everywhere anytime at home. Sometimes I wake up in the morning feeling something heavy on my chest, and it is him, purring.
